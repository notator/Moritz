Sanford.Multimedia.Midi.dll
===========================

This .dll was copied, together with the source code, from GitHub on 30.3.2016
https://github.com/tebjan/Sanford.Multimedia.Midi

I have stored a local copy of the source elsewhere.
This directory just contains the .dll itself with its metadata.

More extensive info can be found in the XML in the .nuspec file
and in the original README.md
